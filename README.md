# Air Quality Prediction WebApp

This web-app can predict air quality within an area on a daily and weekly basis. With these predictions, areas are classified from Good to Hazardous which the municipality can use to take appropriate actions.
The goal is to spread awareness about local air pollution to policy makers, so they can:

1. Analyze what areas are highly polluted and attempt to improve air quality in these areas.
2. Decide whether to give permission for certain activities.

To predict air quality, we make use of trained AI models ([Air Quality Prediction AI](https://github.com/rawan-a-d/Air-Quality-Prediction)).
